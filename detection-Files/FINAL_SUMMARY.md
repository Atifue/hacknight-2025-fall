# ‚úÖ Stutter Detection - Final Tuned Version

## üéØ What I Did

1. **Simplified the code** from 700+ lines ‚Üí **~290 lines** (clean, production-ready)
2. **Fine-tuned all parameters** based on your test cases
3. **Removed debug statements** for production
4. **Added smart logic** to reduce false positives

## üìä Final Parameters (Optimized!)

```python
BLOCK_GAP_SECONDS = 1.0      # Pause between words >= 1.0s = block
PROLONGATION_SECONDS = 2.8   # Word duration >= 2.8s = prolongation (normal words)
PROLONGATION_CONSONANT = 1.6 # Word duration >= 1.6s for prolongable consonants
MIN_REPETITIONS = 3          # Need 3+ consecutive words
MIN_SINGLE_LETTER_REPS = 4   # Single letters need 4+ reps
ACOUSTIC_ONSET_DELTA = 0.12  # High threshold (strict)
MIN_BURSTS = 4               # Need 4+ bursts
```

## üß† Smart Features Added

### 1. **Prolongation Gap-Checking**
- If there's a gap ‚â• 1.0s BEFORE a word ‚Üí Skip prolongation check
- This prevents misclassifying blocks as prolongations
- Example: "very ... pretty" ‚Üí Block detected (not "pretty" as prolongation)

### 2. **Consonant-Specific Thresholds**
- **Prolongable sounds (s, f, r, l, m, n, v, z, sh):** ‚â• 1.6s
- **Other sounds:** ‚â• 2.8s
- Catches "sssssnake" but not "where"

### 3. **First Word Handling**
- **Blocks:** Skip first word gap (includes leading silence)
- **Repetitions:** DON'T skip (real stutters can start at 0.0s)
- **Prolongations:** Normal check (threshold handles it)

### 4. **Acoustic Repetition Intelligence**
- Always infers the specific sound (r, t, st, etc.)
- Checks for consonant clusters (st, sl, tr, etc.)
- Skips if can't infer ‚Üí No "unknown sound" results
- Frontend ALWAYS gets `inferred_sound` and `target_word`

## üéÆ How to Use

### Command Line:
```bash
python3 detection-Files/stutter_detector.py path/to/audio.mp3
```

### Python API:
```python
from detection-Files.stutter_detector import detect_all

results = detect_all("audio.mp3", verbose=True)
events = results['events']  # List of detected stutters
words = results['words']    # Whisper transcription
```

### Frontend Integration:
Already integrated in `server.py` and `backend_api.py`! Just use the existing API:
```
POST /api/analyze
```

## üìã Detection Accuracy

### ‚úÖ Working Great
- **Prolongations:** sssssnake, soooo ‚úÖ
- **Repetitions:** can can can can ‚úÖ
- **Acoustic Reps:** t-t-t-t, r-r-r-r ‚úÖ
- **Blocks:** Most cases ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
1. **Short blocks (<1.0s):** Won't be detected (by design, to avoid false positives)
2. **Whisper normalization:** Some stutters removed from transcription (acoustic detection catches most)
3. **Very subtle prolongations:** Need to be fairly obvious (‚â•1.6s for s/f/r, ‚â•2.8s for others)

## üîß If You Need to Adjust

### To catch MORE stutters:
```python
BLOCK_GAP_SECONDS = 0.8      # Lower (more sensitive)
PROLONGATION_SECONDS = 2.5   # Lower (more sensitive)
PROLONGATION_CONSONANT = 1.4 # Lower (more sensitive)
```

### To catch FEWER false positives:
```python
BLOCK_GAP_SECONDS = 1.2      # Higher (stricter)
PROLONGATION_SECONDS = 3.0   # Higher (stricter)
PROLONGATION_CONSONANT = 1.8 # Higher (stricter)
```

## üöÄ Production Status

**‚úÖ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT!**

The code is:
- Clean and simple (~290 lines)
- Well-tested on your audio samples
- Integrated with frontend
- No debug clutter
- Properly documented

---

## üìÅ Files Changed

1. **`stutter_detector.py`** - Main detection logic (simplified & tuned)
2. **`test_all_audios.py`** - Test suite for all audio files
3. **`TUNING_STATUS.md`** - Detailed tuning notes
4. **`FINAL_SUMMARY.md`** - This file!

---

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Test in frontend** - Run your React app and try recording
2. **Adjust if needed** - Based on real user feedback
3. **Monitor accuracy** - Track false positives/negatives
4. **Fine-tune** - Small adjustments to thresholds as needed

---

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Good microphone** - Clear audio = better detection
2. **Quiet environment** - Less background noise
3. **Clear speech** - Normal volume and pace
4. **Obvious stutters** - The more pronounced, the better
